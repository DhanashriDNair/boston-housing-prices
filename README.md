# Machine Learning project : Boston Housing Prices 

This project applies  basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

**Tasks undertaken as part of the project**
- Obtained important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
- Split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. 
- Analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enabled picking up the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. 
- Tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

**Software and Libraries**

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
